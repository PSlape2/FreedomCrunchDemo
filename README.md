## Project Overview

### Description

Our cereal is uniquely American–it only has one goal: to embody the free RON SWANSON TYPE OF UNITED PATRIOTISM!! Our product is characterized by 4 things: Bacon, Cheese, Heart Attacks, and DEEP FRIED. Our idea? It came to us through the divine word of god in a trance NOT INDUCED BY ANY RECEREATIONAL ILLICIT DRUGS and this idea truly does fully encompass and perhaps even slightly overcome the infinite ecstasy of the human. The 
	It will consist of candied bacon and cheese curds, for a nice textural variation.. We also mean it to be paired with a small drizzle of butter (as we all know, this counts as cereal as milk is butter) and Texas Toast to soak up any remaining delicious glob. Among the sweet, chewy, and savory bacon bits and the extra salty cheesy curds, there is a great paradise to be found in these approximately 2 cm wide bites of heaven. It will be shiny and amazing, like the crude oil that rules our BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY!!! 
	The box is adorned with the colors of patriotism and freedom all around, and it is filled with special tricks and treats, like a supremely theme-appropriate maze and a cover you won’t believe! We confirm ourselves as completely 200% nonpartisan, and we do not want to be sued. This is proved because we have both Biden AND Trump in our box.

 ### Nutritional Impact

 Our genius encapsulates the gravitas of the earth as we have decided to combine the two major parts of the American Diet and make a new dish that combines fat and sugar into one meal. The cholesterol and fat content is negligible, as long as the serving size remains under 0.3 grams, we can absolutely confirm you will not die and at most, will be put in a permanent vegetative state. This is not valid as AMERICANS RAHHH and vegetables are afraid of us, so do not worry!
     The protein gains from the bacon and the fat energy reserves replenished by the cheese curds and the recommended addition of clarified butter will provide a sufficiently filling and stimulating breakfast! Not to mention, the low amount of added sugars will certainly help enhance your health efficiency. That one gram of protein is going to give you so MUCH GAIN!!! The caloric intake being around 7% of the recommended daily intake per tablespoon just means you can’t have anything more than a moderately minuscule bowl of this stuff before suffering a heart attack, BUT IF YOU DON'T NEED TUMS TO SURVIVE IT IS NOT PATRIOTISM!

### Theoretical Marketing

#### Design
While designing the packaging for our product, we used many icons of America. We depicted popular icons such as Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the American flag, and oil rigs. The continued use of red, white, and blue also imbues the customer with patriotism. The satirical depiction of some of the symbols is also meant to amuse our audience.

#### Pricing
We would price our cereal at several affordable price points of $5, $15, and $50. These versions respectively refer to our core values: Expression, Speech, and Pursuit. Such diverse options in the cereal industry are unheard of and will surely lead to a greater edge and an industrial spectacle that will shock the world! Our unique idea pertains to how each option will increase the cereal density so you can get more cereal per serving, thus allowing us to save on extensive shipping costs compared to the extremely mundane option of scaling through sheer colume. Although, the price has to be increased for this luxury as we keep accidentally imploding our trucks with miniature super massive blackholes :(
And, if you preorder FREEDOM CRUNCHTM, you can get a 25% discount and a free FREEDOM SpoonTM on launch. If these price points don’t work for you, you can get the FREEDOM ExpeditionaryTM Plan. The plan uses Affirm in order to allow you to pay over an extended period of time. This one-of-a-kind deal allows you to eat now, and pay later. Available soon, starting at 36% APR (compounded weekly) in up to 4 monthly payments. 100% of our profits will be donated to a charity and a great cause, the cause of GUNS AND CHEESE because this is the true American way. Seriously tho, please donate to your charity of choice to help end injustice and help others around the world!!! We are a 501c certified organization, if by that you mean four children who need money.

#### Promotions
Our product will be promoted across the country, with direct partnerships with the military industrial complex. We plan on lining up a deal with Lockheed Martin for a free ExpressionTM package with every F-35 purchased. In addition, we will offer the chance for YOU to share your FREEDOM CRUNCHTM. Introducing the new FREEDOM PatriotsTM Program, allowing YOU to sell FREEDOM CRUNCHTM in your community. Basically, you buy FREEDOM CRUNCHTM from one of our FREEDOM Distribution Centers at a lower-than-retail price, and sell it to your friends and family. FREEDOM Incorporated will receive only 15% of your sales, allowing you to spread FREEDOM and make money. We would also air our commercial on television and likely launch an online advertising campaign through social media and Google-based advertising.
